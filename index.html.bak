      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <h2>I am Jacquelyn, the face behind the camera, </h2>
	<p>I am so happy you have found me, your future photographer. My name is Jacquelyn and I have been an avid photographer since I was seven years old.  </p>
	 <p> One of my favorite parts of being a photographer meeting families and becoming a part of their moment. I have taken photos of high school seniors who are now married that invited me to capture their wedding moments. </p>
	<p>Take a look at my gallery to see if my style of imagery is something that you would be proud to hang on your wall. I am already looking forward to hearing from you. We have memories to capture. </p>
<h3> Get to Know Me</h3>
	<p> I am a mother to 4 children ranging from teen to toddler.
	I am an animal lover, I have never met an animal that was not my friend. 
	I enjoy being outdoors. 
	I love Christmas!!! 
	I am always looking to grow and try new things. If you have a crazy idea involving photos, I am your girl!</p>
